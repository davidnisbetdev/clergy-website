                        It is with solemn reverence that the Ministry marks the passing of our hallowed matriarch, Sister Imperator. 
                        A visionary of unparalleled conviction, she was the architect of the Clergy's modern era. 
                        It was her indomitable will that forged this Ministry from the fires of defiance, 
                        and her wisdom that orchestrated the grand musical rituals that have spread our unholy gospel to the masses for decades.
                        Her passing is not an end, but a transcendenceâ€” to life eternal. 
                        Her work and spirit endures in the continued mission she set in motion. We shall not mourn, but proceed in the glorious dawn she designed for us.
