                    <h2>Our Unholy Mission</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since time immemorial, the Clergy have operated from the shadows, guiding the course of history with an unseen hand.
                        In this modern era, our sacred duty manifests through the grand spectacle of music rituals performed by "Ghost", our public relations arm.
                        Led by the latest prophet of the papal bloodline, we disseminate our unholy gospel through haunting melodies and captivating rutials delivered from the grandest of stages.
                        Our mission is to dismantle the age of ignorance and hypocrasy, to gather the faithful from all corners of the globe, and to prepare the world for a new, magnificent dawn under His unholy light.
